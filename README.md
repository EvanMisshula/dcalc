=====

This repo creates a console program that calculates a three different distances between two points in space.

Mission
========================================================================
Write a program that displays the following menu to the user:
======================== 3D Distance Calculator ========================
[1]  Change the first point
[2]  Change the second point
[S/s] Display the current two points
[E/e] Calculate and display the Euclidean Distance between the two points
[M/m] Calculate and display the Manhattan Distance between the two points
[C/c] Calculate and display the Chebyshev Distance between the two points
[Q/q] Quit the program
Enter your choice:


Program Requirements:
=====================
The character in the brackets is what the user is expected to type to select the menu item.
[A/a] means that either an uppercase or lowercase ‘a’ can be entered.
Once the user presses a valid key, the program should perform the indicated action.
The option to change a point (1 and 2) should prompt the user to enter the x, y, z coordinated of that point and not display anything else.
After an action is performed, the prompt Enter your choice: should be redisplayed, but not the menu.
If the user enters an invalid choice, the program should just ignore it.
